# Food Bucket App [Hoisted Link]

Welcome to the Food Delivery App, a React project that replicates the functionality of popular food delivery platforms like zomato or Swiggy. This project has been an excellent opportunity for me to learn and grow as a developer. Below are some of the key features:

## Features

- **Restaurant Listings**: Explore a variety of restaurants offering delicious meals.

- **Search Functionality**: Easily search for your favorite restaurants or cuisines.

- **User-Friendly Menu**: Dive into restaurant menus and select your preferred food items.

- **Glow Effect / Shimmer Effect**: Incorporated a 'glow effect' component that is displayed while waiting for the data to render.


- **Cart Functionality**: View the total price of all selected food items in your cart.

- **Cart Management**: Remove specific food items from the cart with a simple click.

- **Clear Cart**: Start afresh with the 'clear cart' button.

- **API Integration**: Real-time data from the Swiggy API enhances the user experience.

- **Browser Setup**: To use the app on your laptop, make sure your browser has a CORS extension enabled to prevent API blocking.

- **Mobile Access**: Please note that while you can access the app on your mobile device, CORS restrictions may prevent you from viewing the restaurant list and menu. Mobile devices typically cannot have CORS extensions to bypass this limitation. Therefore, it's recommended to access the app on a laptop or computer for the optimal experience
